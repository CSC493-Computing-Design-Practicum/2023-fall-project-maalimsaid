Vision and Scope for ASA Website Project

Vision
The vision for the ASA Website project is to establish a vibrant, interactive online hub that not only celebrates but also centralizes the activities and cultural richness of the African Student Association. 
Upon completion, this platform will transform the way members, alumni, and interested individuals connect and interact with each other. 
It will serve as a beacon for cultural exchange, providing a space where the African heritage is shared, celebrated, and preserved. 
The website will become an indispensable resource for the ASA community, fostering a stronger, more connected group that thrives both on and off campus. 
Through this project, the ASA's presence and impact will be significantly amplified, making African culture more accessible and engaging to the broader campus community.

Scope
The scope of the ASA Website project includes the development of a comprehensive website with key features such as a dynamic alumni database, integrated event management system, 
contact and donation functionalities, a newsletter sign-up, and social media integration. The website will be designed with a focus on user-friendly navigation, responsiveness, and accessibility.

Out of scope for this project are the development of a dedicated mobile application, e-commerce capabilities for merchandise sales, and real-time chat functionalities. 
While these features could enhance the user experience, they extend beyond the current resource and time limitations of the project. 
The primary focus will be on establishing a solid and functional web presence, with the potential for future expansions as additional resources become available. 
This approach ensures that the project remains feasible and focused on delivering a high-quality, impactful website for the ASA community.
