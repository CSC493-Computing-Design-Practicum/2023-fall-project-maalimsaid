# *The African Student Association Club Website*
## Description/Motivation

The African Students Association (ASA) at Berea College has been a pivotal institution, fostering understanding, appreciation, and celebration of African cultures and heritage. Over the years, ASA has amassed a wealth of resources, hosted numerous events, and created a strong alumni network. As the current president of ASA and a Computer Science major, I recognize the importance of centralizing these resources, improving communication, and creating a digital footprint that would ensure the continuity and growth of the club. Therefore, I propose the development of a fully integrated and responsive website tailored for the ASA club.
